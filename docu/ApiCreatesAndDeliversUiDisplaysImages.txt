    app.get("/google/logo", function(req, res) {     // this is the api side that receives a get request
    // when received a request (=req) I also have a reference to the response object (=res) 
        var requestSettings = {  // prepare the parameters for a get request I do myself to anorther URL

        // then I send a request to the other URL and pass on a callback function
        // that will prepare my api response to the inital caller (res) and send it with the image in it to him/her   
        request(requestSettings, function(error, response, body) {
            res.set('Content-Type', 'image/png');
